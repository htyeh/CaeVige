We can hack the Caesar cipher by using a cryptanalytic technique called brute-force. A brute-force attack tries every possible decryption key for a cipher. Nothing stops a cryptanalyst from guessing one key, decrypting the ciphertext with that key, looking at the output, and then moving on to the next key if they didn’t find the secret message. Because the brute-force technique is so effective against the Caesar cipher, you shouldn’t actually use the Caesar cipher to encrypt secret information.

Ideally, the ciphertext would never fall into anyone’s hands. But Kerckhoffs’s principle (named after the 19th-century cryptographer Auguste Kerckhoffs) states that a cipher should still be secure even if everyone knows how the cipher works and someone else has the ciphertext. This principle was restated by the 20th-century mathematician Claude Shannon as Shannon’s maxim: “The enemy knows the system.” The part of the cipher that keeps the message secret is the key, and for the Caesar cipher this information is very easy to find.
